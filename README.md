### Assignment 4.3 of the AcadGild Front End Web Dev Course

Create an abstract class Department with one abstract method:  

abstract class Department {  
public name: string;  
constructor (name) {}  
printName(): void { console dept name with appropriate message }  
abstract printMeeting(): void;  
}  

Now extend this abstract class using AccountingDepartment:  

class AccountingDepartment extends Department {  
//Use department class property and methods here }  

Again create 2 more classes for different department and extend department class.  
And then create instance for all and show output using console.

To view solution:
